## Version 0.9.2 (unreleased)

## Version 0.9.1 (2017-10-25)
 * [#79](https://github.com/spray/sbt-revolver/issues/79): 0.9.0 contained some old class files that lead to 
   compatibility problems in combination with other plugins. 0.9.1 was cleanly rebuilt from the same sources 
   and republished to fix the issue. 

## Version 0.9.0 (2017-08-15)
 * First version that supports sbt 1.0.x
 * Allow setting `envVars in reStart` to customize environment variables
